/* 
ðŸ”§ COMPREHENSIVE RLS POLICY CLEANUP
   
   PROBLEM: Duplicate and conflicting RLS policies causing permission errors
   ANALYSIS: Found multiple policies for same tables with different naming conventions
   SOLUTION: Remove ALL policies and recreate clean, consistent ones
   
   Based on your CSV export showing duplicate policies.

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 1: COMPLETE CLEANUP - Remove ALL existing policies
-- =============================================================================

-- Programs table - remove ALL policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "programs_select_by_org" ON programs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "programs_insert_admin" ON programs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "programs_insert_instructor" ON programs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "programs_update_admin_instructor" ON programs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "programs_delete_admin" ON programs;

-- Announcements table - remove ALL policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "announcements_select_by_org" ON announcements;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "announcements_insert_admin_instructor" ON announcements;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "announcements_select_org_metadata" ON announcements;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "announcements_insert_org_metadata" ON announcements;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "announcements_update_org_metadata" ON announcements;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "announcements_delete_org_metadata" ON announcements;

-- Documents table - remove ALL policies (except storage ones)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "documents_select_by_org" ON documents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "documents_insert_by_org" ON documents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert documents" ON documents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "documents_select_org_metadata" ON documents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "documents_insert_org_metadata" ON documents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "documents_update_org_metadata" ON documents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "documents_delete_org_metadata" ON documents;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "documents_insert_own" ON documents;
