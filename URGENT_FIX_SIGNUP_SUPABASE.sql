/* 
üîß FIX SIGNUP DATABASE ERROR - VERIFICATION
   
   PROBLEM: The signup process is failing with "Database error saving new user"
   CAUSE: There's a trigger on auth.users that tries to insert into the dropped profiles table
   SOLUTION: Remove the trigger and function that reference the profiles table
   
   Copy and paste this entire script into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it.
*/

-- Remove the trigger that's causing the signup error
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;

-- Remove the function that tries to insert into profiles table
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_new_user();

-- The following might error if profiles table doesn't exist - that's OK!
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS profiles_updated_at ON public.profiles;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_updated_at();

-- VERIFICATION: Check if the problematic trigger is gone
