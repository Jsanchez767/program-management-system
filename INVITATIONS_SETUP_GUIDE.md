# Enhanced Invitations System Setup Guide

## Environment Variables Required

Add this to your `.env.local` file:

```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

To get your service role key:
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" → "API"
3. Copy the "service_role" key (NOT the anon key)
4. Add it to your `.env.local` file

## Database Setup

1. Copy and paste the contents of `ENHANCED_INVITATIONS_FIX.sql` into your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Click "Run" to apply the database changes

## Features Implemented

### 1. Complete Invitation Process
- ✅ Name fields (first_name, last_name) added to invitation form
- ✅ User account creation via Supabase Admin API
- ✅ Automatic email confirmation sent to new users
- ✅ Invitation tracking with status updates

### 2. Enhanced Invitation Management
- ✅ Display invitee names in the invitations table
- ✅ Status tracking: Pending → User Created → Awaiting Confirmation → Accepted
- ✅ Resend invitation functionality
- ✅ Copy invitation link functionality
- ✅ Delete invitation functionality

### 3. Database Schema Updates
- ✅ Added `first_name` and `last_name` columns
- ✅ Added `user_id` column to link with created users
- ✅ Added `status` column with proper constraints
- ✅ Enhanced RLS policies for proper security
- ✅ Added database indexes for better performance

### 4. API Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/invitations/create-user` - Creates user account and sends confirmation
- ✅ `/api/invitations/resend` - Resends confirmation or extends invitation

## How It Works

1. **Admin sends invitation**: Fills out name, email, and role
2. **System creates user**: Uses Supabase Admin API to create account with metadata
3. **Invitation recorded**: Saves invitation with user details and status
4. **Email sent**: Supabase automatically sends email confirmation
5. **User confirms**: User clicks email link to verify and can then login
6. **Status updated**: System tracks the invitation progress

## Testing the System

1. Apply the database changes with `ENHANCED_INVITATIONS_FIX.sql`
2. Add the service role key to your environment variables
3. Restart your Next.js development server
4. Go to Admin → Invitations
5. Fill out the form with name, email, and role
6. Click "Send Invitation"
7. Check the invitations table to see the new entry with status "User Created"
8. The invited user will receive an email to confirm their account

## Troubleshooting

- If you get authentication errors, check that `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is correctly set
- If invitations don't appear, check the RLS policies in Supabase
- If users can't confirm, verify the email settings in Supabase Auth
